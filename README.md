**Project Overview**

This Project is conducted to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. This project involves performing EDA and answering specific questions related to sales in the retail and e-commerce domain.

**Objectives**

1) Creating and populating a retail sales database with the provided sales data
2) Identifying and removing any records with missing or null values
3) Performing basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset
4) Use of SQL to answer important, specific business questions and derive insights from sales data
